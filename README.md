#### Motivation
My wife is a game designer and she asked me to create a game server for her. I started to look for a game server that could be used for her game, but I couldn't find anything ready made and had ultra-low latency capabilities since mostly they are packed with features which might never be used. So I decided to create one.

# **Ultra-Low-Latency Java Game Server**

A **bare-bones, scalable game server** in Java designed for **ultra-low latency** turn-based games (like chess). This project demonstrates:

- **Pure Java WebSocket** implementation (no Tomcat/Jetty/Netty).
- **Protobuf-based message serialization** for efficient data transfer.
- **Redis Pub/Sub** for horizontal scaling across multiple server instances.
- **NGINX/HAProxy** or similar load balancer for distributing WebSocket connections.

Although **chess** is used as the example, the same architecture can be extended to **lightweight real-time or turn-based** games.

## **Project Overview**

This repository contains an ultra-lightweight WebSocket server written in pure Java. It is designed for turn-based games where latency and reliability are crucial. By default, it shows how to handle chess moves, but it can be extended to any minimal real-time or turn-based gaming scenario.

Key goals:
	•	Minimal Dependencies: No Tomcat, no Jetty, no Spring Boot—just Java’s ServerSocket.
	•	Scalability: Horizontal scaling through Redis Pub/Sub.
	•	Efficient Data Serialization: Use of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) to minimize message size and parsing overhead.
	•	Maintainability: Simple code structure that’s easy to extend for new features or different game types.

## **Architecture**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C[Clients <br/>(WebSocket)] --> LB(Load Balancer<br/>(NGINX/HAProxy))
    LB --> S1(Game Server #1<br/>- Bare WebSocket<br/>- Protobuf<br/>- Redis Pub/Sub)
    LB --> S2(Game Server #2<br/>- Bare WebSocket<br/>- Protobuf<br/>- Redis Pub/Sub)
    S1 -->|Publish/Subscribe| R[Redis Pub/Sub]
    S2 -->|Publish/Subscribe| R[Redis Pub/Sub]
```

1.	Bare WebSocket Server: Handles game actions (like chess moves) via WebSocket frames (no HTTP polling).
2.	Protobuf Messages: Minimizes data size & improves parse speed.
3.	Redis Pub/Sub: Broadcasts moves between servers. This allows multiple server instances to stay in sync.
4.	Load Balancer: Distributes WebSocket connections evenly among all servers.

## **Features**
1.	Ultra-Lightweight Server
	•	No external application servers; just Java Sockets and a WebSocket handshake.
2.	Real-Time Communication
	•	Uses WebSockets for near-instant updates (no HTTP polling overhead).
3.	Protobuf Serialization
	•	Smaller message payloads than JSON or XML.
	•	Strongly typed schemas.
4.	Redis Pub/Sub for Scaling
	•	Multiple server instances can sync game states.
	•	Servers publish or subscribe to “chess_moves” (or any channel you want).
5.	Load Balancer Integration
	•	Example config for NGINX to handle WebSocket connections.

## **Prerequisites**
	•	Java 8+ (or any modern JDK).
	•	Maven (or Gradle) for dependency management (if you choose to package your server this way).
	•	Protobuf Compiler (protoc)
	•	Install via GitHub Releases or your package manager.
	•	Redis (for Pub/Sub), optional but required for scaling.

## **Setup & Installation**
1.	Clone the Repository
2.	Install Protobuf Compiler
	•	macOS: `brew install protobuf`
	•	Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler`
	•	Windows: Download from Protobuf Releases.
3.	Compile Protobuf Schema (if you have a .proto file such as chess.proto)
    •   bash: `protoc chess.proto`

```bash
protoc --java_out=src/main/java src/main/proto/chess.proto
```
Adjust the paths to match your project structure.
    4.	Build the Project
	•	Maven: mvn clean install
	•	Gradle: gradle build

## **Running the Server**

	Note: The simplest approach is to run your main class (e.g., BareWebSocketServer) directly from your IDE or command line after compiling.
    Though, you can also package your server as a JAR file and run it as a standalone application. But I'm a fan of running it the hardway from CLI as I'm an Nvim user. I don't use Arch btw.

1.	Start Redis (if you want scaling)

```bash
redis-server
```
2.	Run Single Server

```bash
java -cp target/UltraLowLatencyGameServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.BareWebSocketServer
```

This starts a WebSocket server on ws://localhost:8080.

3.	Optional: Run Multiple Servers Manually
	•	Change the port in your second server instance (e.g., to 8090) and start it.
	•	Both servers connect to Redis. Moves from one server are published; the other server subscribes and broadcasts to its connected clients.

## **Testing Locally**

1.	Open Browser Console or use a WebSocket client (e.g., websocat or Postman) to connect:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");
ws.onopen = () => {
    console.log("Connected");
};
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log("Server says:", event.data);
};
ws.onclose = () => console.log("Disconnected");
```

2.	Send a “move” from one client, see if all other connected clients receive it in real-time.

## **Scaling with Redis & Load Balancers**

1.	Redis Pub/Sub
	•	Each server publishes any incoming move to a Redis channel (e.g., "chess_moves").
	•	Each server subscribes to that same channel, receiving moves from other servers.
2.	Load Balancer (NGINX)
	•	Install & Configure NGINX for WebSocket load balancing:

```nginx
http {
  upstream chess_game {
    server localhost:8080;
    server localhost:8085;
  }
  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourserver.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://chess_game;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
  }
}
```

	•	Run NGINX, and direct all WebSocket connections to ws://yourserver.com/.

3.	Multiple Servers
	•	Start multiple instances (java BareWebSocketServer) on different ports (8080, 8085, 8100…).
	•	All instances read from the same Redis server, ensuring real-time synchronization.

	1.	chess.proto – Defines the Protobuf message for a chess move (or any turn-based action).
	2.	BareWebSocketServer.java – The core WebSocket server implementation without any external containers.
	3.	RedisHandler.java – Subscribes/publishes moves to Redis.
	4.	ChessMove.java – Auto-generated by Protobuf compiler from chess.proto.

## **Extending & Customizing**

1.	Adding a New Game
	•	Create a new .proto schema with the required fields for your game’s events.
	•	Generate Java classes using protoc.
	•	Adjust BareWebSocketServer or create a new server class to handle these game events.
2.	Improving Security
	•	Implement TLS (using wss://) at the load balancer (NGINX) or within the Java server.
	•	Add authentication tokens to WebSocket messages to identify players.
3.	State Management
	•	Use an in-memory or Redis store to keep track of each game’s state (e.g., board positions, turn timers).
4.	High Availability
	•	Deploy servers behind a Kubernetes or Docker Swarm cluster.
	•	Use a managed Redis service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache).

## **FAQ**

1.	Why not use HTTP Polling?
	•	WebSockets provide lower overhead and real-time updates. HTTP Polling is inefficient and increases latency.
2.	Why Protobuf instead of JSON?
	•	Smaller payloads and faster parsing. In real-time games, every millisecond counts.
3.	Can I run more than two servers?
	•	Absolutely. Just add more servers (S3, S4, …), all subscribing to the same Redis Pub/Sub channel.
4.	How to handle concurrency or locking on game state?
	•	Typically, you’ll maintain a consistent game state in a shared store (Redis, database) or implement row-level locks if needed. For simple turn-based games, a single server thread is often sufficient.
5.	Is it production-ready?
	•	This project is a foundation. You should add error handling, security, and robust load testing before going live.
